Phase 4 is **in progress**. Governed caller-supplied embeddings and deterministic vector retrieval are implemented, as are deterministic prompt compilation and strict structural output admission. Learned/cross-encoder reranking, authority/freshness ranking, partial truncation, provider tokenization, semantic citation fidelity/entailment, semantic safety, tutor inference and concrete providers, networking, vector databases, and durable adapters remain unimplemented. The reconstructed knowledge and tutor specifications retain their registry authority; these increments do not promote them. The known inconsistency between implemented ingestion/context evidence here and unchecked corresponding roadmap bullets is intentionally not resolved by this increment.
